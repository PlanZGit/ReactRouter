1. What and Why
   It's a fully feature client side and server-side routing library for React
   Helps create and navigate between different URLs that make up your web application
   Provides unique URLs for different components in the app and makes th UI easily shareable with others

Pre-requisites
-React Fundamentals
-React Hooks

2.  Installation and setup
    npx create-react-app react-router-demo
    npm install react-router-dom@6

3.  Configuring Routes
    Wrap the root component of the app with <BrowserRouter> from react-router-dom
    Create componenets that need to be rendered at different url <Home> <About>
    Config the Routes using <routes> and <route> components from react-router-dom
    Routes contain multiply route components, each route accept a path prop
    which corresponds to the path in the browser url and the react element render
    when th path is matched

        <BrowserRouter>
          <App />
        </BrowserRouter>

        <Routes>
          <Route path="/" element={<Home />}></Route>
          <Route path="about" element={<About />}></Route>
        </Routes>

        http://localhost:3000
        http://localhost:3000/about

4.  Links
    Create a Navbar component
    Clicking the links will navigave to the urls

        import { Link } from "react-router-dom"
        <Link to="/">Home</Link>
        <Link to="/about">About</Link>

    Add Navbar component to App.js
