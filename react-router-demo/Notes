1. What and Why
   It's a fully feature client side and server-side routing library for React
   Helps create and navigate between different URLs that make up your web application
   Provides unique URLs for different components in the app and makes th UI easily shareable with others

Pre-requisites
-React Fundamentals
-React Hooks

2.  Installation and setup
    npx create-react-app react-router-demo
    npm install react-router-dom@6

3.  Configuring Routes
    Wrap the root component of the app with <BrowserRouter> from react-router-dom
    Create componenets that need to be rendered at different url <Home> <About>
    Config the Routes using <routes> and <route> components from react-router-dom
    Routes contain multiply route components, each route accept a path prop
    which corresponds to the path in the browser url and the react element render
    when th path is matched

    index.js

        <BrowserRouter>
          <App />
        </BrowserRouter>

    App.js

        <Routes>
          <Route path="/" element={<Home />}></Route>
          <Route path="about" element={<About />}></Route>
        </Routes>

        http://localhost:3000
        http://localhost:3000/about

4.  Links
    Create a Navbar component
    Add Navbar component to App.js
    Use the links will navigave to the urls

        import { Link } from "react-router-dom"
        <Link to="/">Home</Link>
        <Link to="/about">About</Link>

5.  Active Links
    Use Navlink, by default it receives an active class when the link is the current route
    Inspect the element, with this active class , we can use it to add some styles
    We can style the active class either in index.css or the active boolean flag injected into the style function

    Link vs Navlink
    Navlink is use for navbar / breadcrumbs / set of tabs
    where you would like to highlight the current seleected item
    useful context with screen readers

    Link
    Navigate other parts of the app
    we would not want active link to be applied
    when it is not needed

    Navbar.js

          import { Navlink } from "react-router-dom"
          <NavLink to="/">Home</NavLink>
          <NavLink to="/about">About</NavLink>

    index.css

          nav a.active {
          text-decoration: none;
          font-weight: bold;
          }

    Using active link as the style props

    Navbar.js

        const navLinkStyles = ({ isActive }) => {
          return {
            fontWeight: isActive ? "bold" : "normal",
            textDecoration: isActive ? "none" : "underline",
          };
        };
